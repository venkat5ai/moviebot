## What the App Does

My Movie Studio is a web application that allows you to search for movies and retrieve detailed information about them. The app leverages external APIs to fetch movie data, including ratings from popular sources like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes.

Key Features:

- **Movie Search:** Easily search for movies using a search bar.
